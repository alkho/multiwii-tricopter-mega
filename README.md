# multiwii-tricopter-mega
copter club's sensor bristling tricopter

Find enclosed (1) working set of code for the copter club's tricopter. 
It's already configured but there are no major changes from Multiwii 2.4

Notes on the physical copter: 
The arducopter shield is a bit weird in that the ESC (motor) plugins are power inputs and not outputs. Therefore if you want the servo to work you'll have to plug that into a different 5V plug on the board.
